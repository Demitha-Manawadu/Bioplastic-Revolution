# Ocean's Gift - Sri Lanka's Bioplastic Revolution

Welcome to **Ocean's Gift**, a sustainable initiative tackling plastic pollution by developing eco-friendly bioplastics using seaweed. Our project aims to reduce plastic waste, protect marine ecosystems, and support coastal communities in Sri Lanka.

## 🚀 Project Overview
Ocean's Gift focuses on creating biodegradable plastic films from locally sourced seaweed. This bioplastic serves as a sustainable alternative to traditional plastic used for packaging and food storage. By collaborating with coastal communities, we ensure a continuous supply of seaweed while empowering local economies.

## 🌊 Problem Statement
- Sri Lanka discards **12 million lunch sheets** and **4 million plastic bags** daily.
- Coastal and marine pollution severely impact marine life and the tourism industry.
- Microplastic contamination is a growing concern, posing health risks.

## 🧪 Our Solution
We aim to:
- Produce biodegradable seaweed-based bioplastics as a plastic alternative.
- Establish a sustainable seaweed farming network.
- Educate and collaborate with local businesses to reduce plastic use.
- Implement a monitoring system to track the reduction in plastic pollution.

## 🌿 Key Features
- **Eco-friendly**: Fully biodegradable within 60-90 days in soil and marine environments.
- **Cost-Effective**: Affordable for small businesses compared to traditional plastics.
- **Community Empowerment**: Provides job opportunities for local seaweed farmers and production staff.
- **Plastic Monitoring System**: Tracks plastic reduction with incentives for eco-friendly businesses.

## 📍 Target Locations
- Coastal areas of Sri Lanka, focusing initially on Hikkaduwa, Bentota, and Galle.
- Expansion plans to Maldives, Thailand, and other South Asian coastal regions.

## 📊 Impact Goals
- Reduce single-use plastics by **10%** in targeted coastal regions.
- Create **500+ jobs** through seaweed farming and bioplastic production.
- Improve marine biodiversity and support Sri Lanka's eco-tourism.
